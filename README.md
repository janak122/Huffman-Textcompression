# Text file compression

:point_right:   **Steps....**

- download encode.jar & decode.jar
- open encode.jar by double clicking on it 
- select .txt file [samples available under ***[/test_data](https://github.com/janak122/Huffman-Textcompression/tree/main/test_data)*** folder] and click on compress button
- it will generate compress.dat [binary file & not readable]
-  open decode.jar by double clicking on it 
- select recently generated ***compress.dat*** file and click on decompress button
-  u will get your original file back

:scroll:  **Note ....**

- it works only for text file [.txt ] not for binary [ eg. video, audio ] since [huffman encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) is frequency based encoding  and binary files do not preserve any frequency characteristic
